# AI Advertising Generation Finetuning Proposal

Files for training / fine-tuning our SD3 model -- the important one is SD3MiniDBLoraFinetune.ipynb, which contains an end-to-end process for fine-tuning a minature version of the SD3 model. Full version TBD via Lightning.AI.

The resultant LoRA weights are available in /trained-sd3-lora-miniature.
